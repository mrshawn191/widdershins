<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>The intended audience for this document is the person responsible for the technical integration. Basic
knowledge of networking programming and monetary transactions are required. Any operating system
and any programming language can be used to implement the Integration API which is needed by
PaymentIQ.</p>
<p>The PaymentIQ Integration API uses JSON, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON</a>, for all data
interchange. It is language independent and supported for virtually all programming languages. All
methods are invoked by sending a valid JSON request via HTTPS POST.</p>
<p>Note: The PaymentIQ Integration API expects all requests and responses to be UTF-8 encoded</p>
<p>Valid currency codes are upper case 3-letter characters according to ISO 4217, <a href="ttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217</a>. Number of digits after the decimal are also defined by the ISO
standard, e.g JPY (Japanese yen) has 0 digits after the decimal. </p>

<h1 id="integration-overview">Integration Overview</h1>
<p>One of the main architectural goals with PaymentIQ is to have it loosely coupled from the operator's
platform so the two systems can evolve independently without affecting each other. For example,
payment methods can be added, modified or updated without affecting the operator's platform. The
operator can update and modify it's system without affecting PaymentIQ and vice versa</p>
<img id="integration-image" src="images/integration-image.png" alt="integration-image">
<p>In order to achieve the separation of concerns, the integration between the operator's platform and
PaymentIQ is reverted, i.e. PaymentIQ calls the Operator Platform instead of the Operator Platform
calls PaymentIQ. </p>
<p>Therefore, the operator needs to implement the Integration API as specified in this document. </p>
<p>For more information regarding the Front API, please see the 'Front-end API' documentation. </p>

<h1 id="operator-platform">Operator Platform</h1>
<p>The sequence diagram below describes how PaymentIQ calls the Operator Platform. The example is
showing a credit card deposit without 3DS, but the flow between PaymentIQ and the Operator Platform
is the same regardless of payment method or payment type. </p>

<h2 id="ip-address">IP-Address whitelist</h2>
<p>These are the IP-addresses that PaymentIQ uses for the communication with the merchant, and are the
ones that needs to be whitelisted by merchant.</p>

<h2 id="sessionid">Session-id</h2>
<p>The session-id that is present in the /verifyuser request is created by the merchant, and is given in the
initial request in the 'Front API'. PaymentIQ simply forwards it in order for the merchant to verify that
it is valid.</p>
